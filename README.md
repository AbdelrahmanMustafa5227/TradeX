## üìÑ Description

The system features a background job mechanism that dynamically updates the prices of various cryptocurrencies at random intervals.
These price fluctuations simulate the unpredictable nature of actual cryptocurrency markets.

Users can place two types of orders‚ÄîSpot Orders and Future Orders‚Äîbased on their preferred trading strategies:
- Spot Orders: Instantaneous buy or sell transactions at current market prices.
- Future Orders: Orders set to execute at a predetermined price point or condition, enabling users to strategize based on future market expectations.

Users can place buy or sell orders for cryptocurrencies based on their market analysis. 
The system automatically monitors the price changes and executes orders when the specified conditions are met, such as the price reaching a user-defined threshold.
